# Goose-escpae-game
A minimalist 2-D arcade game where the main player needs to escape from being chased by an angry goose!

### Game Features
1. Apart from the player and goose, there is a _safe zone_, _power-up zone_, _player health bar_ and a _wall_ in the game
2. The positions of these zones are randomly generated in every new game
3. You have 3 lives per game and the _power-up_ can only be used once to get back your full health
4. The _wall_ can be used to block the goose from moving. **But beware, the goose is unpredictable and can often jump the walls**
5. Reaching the _safe zone_ is the goal to win the game!
